About Biblio Café
<br>
Biblio Café is a front-end development project designed to showcase a cohesive brand experience across a multi-page web architecture. Unlike simple one-page sites, this project handles complex data presentation—such as menu pricing tables and structured store hours—within a sophisticated visual theme.

## Project Objectives
* **Information Architecture:** Organizing business-critical information (About, Menu, Hours, Contact) into a logical user flow.
* **Semantic Integrity:** Using the correct HTML5 tags to ensure the site is SEO-friendly and accessible to screen readers.
* **Visual Consistency:** Maintaining a "Premium Library" aesthetic through a unified CSS design system using custom variables and professional typography.

## Technical Implementation
* **Layout:** Utilized **CSS Grid** for the complex "Hours" description list and **Flexbox** for a responsive navigation system.
* **Layering:** Applied negative margins to create a modern "overlapping" hero effect, giving the UI a 3D depth.
* **Data Structures:** Implemented HTML `<table>` for menu items and `<dl>` (description lists) for scheduling, demonstrating proper data categorization.
